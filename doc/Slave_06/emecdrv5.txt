1000:
Device Type


The device type specifies the kind of device. The lower 16 bit contain the device profile number and the upper 16 bit an additional information.
1001:
Error Register


The error register is a field of 8 bits, each for a certain error type. If an error occurs the bit has to be set.

Bit Meaning
0  generic error
1  current
2  voltage
3  temperature
4  communication error (overrun, error state)
5  device profile specific
6  reserved
7  manufacturer specific
1005:
COB-ID SYNC


COB-ID of the Synchronization object.
The device generates a SYNC message if bit 30 is set.
The meaning of other bits is equal to the other communication objects.
1008:
Manufacturer Device Name


Contains the device name.
1009:
Manufacturer Hardware Version


Contains the device hardware version.
100A:
Manufacturer Software Version


Contains the device software version.
100C:
Guard Time


This entry contains the guard time in ms. The value 0 means, that the guard time is not used.
100D:
Life Time Factor


The life time factor multiplied with the guard time gives the life time for the device.
It is 0, if not used.
1010:
Store Parameter Field


This entry supports saving of parameters in non volatile memory.
With a read access the device provides information about
its saving capabilities. Several parameter groups are distinguished.

Sub index 1      : all parameters
Sub index 2      : communication parameters
Sub index 3      : application parameters
Sub index 4 - 127: manufacturer defined parameters

For saving the signature "save" (0x65766173) must be written.
The CANopen library by port contains an extensions for clear ("kill").
1016:
Heartbeat Consumer Entries


The consumer heartbeat time defines the expected heartbeat cycle
time and thus has to be higher than the corresponding producer heartbeat
time configured on the device producing this heartbeat.

The bits 31 - 24 of each sub-index has to be 0.
The bits 23 - 16 contain the node-id.
The lower 16 bits contain the heartbeat time
1017:
Producer Heartbeat Time


The producer heartbeat time defines the cycle time of the heartbeat. If the time is 0 it is not used. The time has to be a multiple of 1 ms.
1018:
Identity Object


This object contains general information about the
device.
Sub-Index 1 contains a unique value allocated each manufacturer.
Sub-Index 2 identifies the manufacturer specific product code (device version).
Sub-Index 3 contains the revision number.
Bit 31-16 is the major revision number and Bit 15-0 the minor revision number.
Sub-Index 4 identifies a manufacturer specific serial number.
1200:
Server SDO Parameter 1


The object contains the parameters for the SDOs for which
the device is the server.
1400:
Receive PDO Communication Parameter 1


It contains the communication parameters of the current PDO
the device is able to receive.
Sub-index 0 contains the number of PDO-parameters implemented.
Sub index 1 describes the COB-ID. If bit 31 is set the PDO is disabled.
The  transmission mode is defined by sub-index 2.
An inhibit time can be defined on sub-index 3 in 100 us.
At the 5th sub-index can be defined a event time for asynchron pdos.
1600:
Receive PDO Mapping Parameter 1


The sub-indices contain the indices, the sub-indices and the
lengths of the mapped sub-indices.

Their structure is as follows:
index (16bit)   sub-index (8bit)   length (8bit)
1800:
Transmit PDO Communication Parameter 1


It contains the communication parameters of the current PDO
the device is able to transmit.
Sub-index 0 contains the number of PDO-parameters implemented.
Sub index 1 describes the COB-ID. If bit 31 is set the PDO is disabled.
The transmission mode is defined by sub-index 2.
An inhibit time can be defined on sub-index 3 in 100 us.
At the 5th sub-index can be defined a event time for asynchron pdos.
1801:
Transmit PDO Communication Parameter 2


It contains the communication parameters of the current PDO
the device is able to transmit.
Sub-index 0 contains the number of PDO-parameters implemented.
Sub index 1 describes the COB-ID. If bit 31 is set the PDO is disabled.
The transmission mode is defined by sub-index 2.
An inhibit time can be defined on sub-index 3 in 100 us.
At the 5th sub-index can be defined a event time for asynchron pdos.
1A00:
Transmit PDO Mapping Parameter 1


Contains the mapping for the PDOs the device is able to transmit.
The type of the PDO mapping parameter is at index 21h.
The subindex 0h contains the number of valid entires within the mapping record.
This number of entries is also the number of the application variables
which shall be transmitted with the corresponding PDO.
The subindicex from 1h to number of entries contain the information
about the mapped application variables.
These entries describe the PDO contents by their index, subindex and length.
Allthree values are hexa-decimal coded.
The length entry contains the length of the object in bits (1..40h).
This parameter can be used to verify the overall mapping length. It is mandatory.
1A01:
Transmit PDO Mapping Parameter 2


Contains the mapping for the PDOs the device is able to transmit.
The type of the PDO mapping parameter is at index 21h.
The subindex 0h contains the number of valid entires within the mapping record.
This number of entries is also the number of the application variables
which shall be transmitted with the corresponding PDO.
The subindicex from 1h to number of entries contain the information
about the mapped application variables.
These entries describe the PDO contents by their index, subindex and length.
Allthree values are hexa-decimal coded.
The length entry contains the length of the object in bits (1..40h).
This parameter can be used to verify the overall mapping length. It is mandatory.
1F51:
Program Control


This array controls the programs residing at index 0x1F50. The sub-Index 0 contains the number of program control entries. All further sub-indices control the programs. They can have the following values:

for writing:
0 - stop program
1 - start program
2-  reset program
3-  clear program

for reading:
0 - program stopped
1 - program running
2 - program stopped
3 - no program available
